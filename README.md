# COVID-19 Vaccination Progress Data Analysis
___
The vaccination campaign started around three months ago already and with so many information in the media, it may be difficult to get the big picture.

This data analysis is focused on summarizing how the Covid-19 vaccination is going around the world. More accurately, it is focused on answering the following questions 

* How many types of vaccine are used? Where a specific vaccine is used in the world?
* Where are vaccinated more people per day? Is the number of daily vaccinations going up?
* In Europe, in which region the vaccination programme is more advanced? When will we have 25% of the population vaccinated?

Data is downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress) and is collected daily from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data) GitHub repository for Covid-19.
